üëãüõ≥Ô∏è Ahoy, welcome to Kaggle! You‚Äôre in the right place.
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition ‚Äì the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Then check out Alexis Cook‚Äôs Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!

# The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

# My Solution
__Applying Logistic Regreesion__

It outperforms other machine learning models as shown:

__Advantages:__

1. Simplicity: Logistic Regression is a relatively simple and straightforward model, making it easy to implement and interpret.

2. Binary Output: Logistic Regression is designed to work with binary outcomes, making it ideal for classification problems.

3. Multivariate analysis: Logistic Regression can handle multiple independent variables, making it possible to analyze the relationship between multiple predictor variables and the binary outcome.

4. Probabilistic output: Logistic Regression provides a probability score for each data point, making it easier to rank the importance of individual predictors and to make predictions.

# Final Result:
Below shows the predicted result on the given testing dataset, and a complete csv file is attached in the files above named "Titanic Results from Neal Xu"

__1: Survived;__

__0: Not Survived:__
